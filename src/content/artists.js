          'Huma is the personal project of Andrés Satué, half of the duo Esquelas, project in which they released “Inciso” (Ensmble) and more recently “Un pozo lleno de anzuelos” (Bestiarie). He was participant in the RedBull Muisc Academy BassCamp in Madrid 2015. He is also cofounder of Versal and Bicefal.',
          'This is his first EP as Huma. “Las tres fases del movimiento" is based on two ideas, on one hand the three phases of movement of Meyerhold biomechanics, and on the other hand the three phases of movement in bodybuilding. Joining these two ideas he generates a very physical, visceral and emotional journey.',
          '«A visceral and emotion-laden situation that sometimes seems to set in front of the abyss, but the most important thing is that it generates a movement.» —David Gozálvez, Neonized',
          '"... Huma manages to make his music a purely corporeal act: his cuts are like dancers who move in complex and different ways in space. Sometimes they move as if they want to touch the sky ... » — Fantastic Plastic',
          '«The intersection between extreme, saturation and depth is what describes this new project of Andrés Satué ...» — Frankie Pizá, This Is Underground',

          'From the physical transformation of organic elements that melt generating new textures, Espleni is created. Fragmented into nine pieces, it starts with an inmersive melody starting a route without return where you can explore frozen territories of heavy structures. This reflects the union between body and raw material, an interest that was already glimpsed in its first release with Bestiarie (2015). The distortion of organic sounds arrives to wide landscapes of noise, sometimes moderated and in others uncontrolled. Noises that are juxtaposed in a constant dialogue until its definitive bifurcation.',
          'This project starts from the recording of everyday sounds that surround the author, using a Zoom H5 recorder, with which he later experiments, manipulating and gathering them until creating a musically harmonic composition.',
